My name is Thibault Vergne. I currently work at Asobo studios as a engine programmer on "A Plague Tale: Requiem". This place is my home for my spare time projects. Following are the two project I am currently working on:
- [Atlas](https://github.com/Uedaki/Atlas), a physically based offline renderer based on Hyperion
- [Atlas-Maya](https://github.com/Uedaki/Atlas-Maya), a Maya plugin to use Atlas inside of Autodesk Maya
